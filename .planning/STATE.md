# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-11)

**Core value:** Two agents exchange a message in real time (sub-second while a recipient is actively waiting) with zero per-agent custom plumbing — wiring a new agent is one HTTP MCP config line.
**Current focus:** v1.1 roadmap defined — Phase 6 is next (Gateway Stand-Up + Switchboard Redeploy)

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 6 — Gateway Stand-Up + Switchboard Redeploy (not started)
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap defined, ready to plan Phase 6
Last activity: 2026-06-11 — v1.1 roadmap created (Phases 6-8)

### Milestone v1.0 — Built & verified

- Phase 1-2 (Bus Core + Presence/Wake/Awareness): server.js/bus.js/tools.js/schema.sql — 12 MCP tools + REST /status,/activity. Smoke test green (<1s delivery, drain, no-redelivery, channels, instruction→result, presence, activity).
- Phase 3 (Ship): ghcr.io/jemplayer82/mcp-agentbus:latest via CI; deployed as STANDALONE Portainer stack (deviation from "merge into mcp-shared" — chosen for zero blast radius on the 9-service production stack; reversible). Live /healthz ok, durability proven across container recreate.
- Phase 4 (Wire + hooks): Claude Code .claude.json entry added (backup at C:/tmp/claude.json.backup-*); awareness hooks merged into ~/.claude/settings.json (backup at C:/tmp/claude-settings.backup-*); ~/.agentbus/config.json written. Hooks tested live. **Takes effect on next Claude Code restart.**
- Port note: 3107 was taken by mcp-home-assistant → host 3108.
- Token: C:/tmp/agentbus-token.txt (also in .claude.json + ~/.agentbus/config.json). NOT committed.
- Phase 5 (Verify): Blocked on Hermes wiring (OpenClaw host not accessible). VERIFY-02 deferred.

### Milestone v1.1 — In planning

- Phase 6: Gateway Stand-Up + Switchboard Redeploy — NOT STARTED
- Phase 7: Playwright Scraper Behind Gateway — NOT STARTED
- Phase 8: Client Rewire + End-to-End Verify — NOT STARTED

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- One centralized HTTP MCP server = the bus (no broker) — shared state is automatic
- Long-poll `wait_for_message` is the real-time primitive (MCP can't push to an idle LLM)
- Stateless per-request transport + module-level singleton bus (matches existing repos)
- `better-sqlite3` over experimental `node:sqlite` — synchronous, single-writer-safe with WAL
- LAN addressing `192.168.7.50:3108` (3107 was taken), single shared `AGENTBUS_MCP_TOKEN`
- (v1.1) Supergateway on `:8000` fronts all MCP servers — single host:port; new backends mount without new ports
- (v1.1) Scraper = wrap official `@playwright/mcp`, not a bespoke build — upstream-maintained, browsers baked into image
- (v1.1 open) Path-routing mechanism on `:8000` (one supergateway per backend behind nginx vs. path-router) — to be resolved in Phase 6 plan step

### Pending Todos

- Resolve open decision: how exactly does path routing work on `:8000`? One supergateway instance per backend behind `mcp-nginx-proxy`, or a dedicated path-router? Decide before Phase 6 implementation.
- Phase 6: identify and update all stale `agentbus` / id 63 / `:3108` references before redeployment.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **[Phase 5 — HELD] Hermes wiring is the user's step.** Hermes runs on the OpenClaw host (192.168.1.19); SSH not accessible to Claude. To wire: add HTTP MCP entry `agentbus` → `http://192.168.7.50:3108/mcp` with bearer token from `C:/tmp/agentbus-token.txt`. Once wired, VERIFY-02 can run. This may be superseded by v1.1 gateway rewire (CONN-04).
- [Phase 2/4] `wake_url` push depends on OpenClaw exposing a reachable run-trigger endpoint. Falls back to persistent long-poll loop if not available.
- [Phase 4] Claude Code cannot be webhook-woken — no `wake_url` for Claude; async path is turn-boundary hooks only.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Verification | VERIFY-02 (Hermes round-trip) | Blocked on Hermes wiring — user step | Phase 5 |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-11
Stopped at: v1.1 roadmap created (Phases 6-8); REQUIREMENTS traceability updated
Resume file: None
Next action: `/gsd:plan-phase 6` — resolve path-routing open decision, then plan gateway stand-up
